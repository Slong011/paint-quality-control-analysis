# Paint Manufacturing Quality Control Report

## Overview
This project presents a statistical quality control analysis for a paint manufacturing company experiencing variation concerns in their 4-liter paint cans. The objective was to determine whether variations in filled amounts are within acceptable control limits or indicative of special cause variation.

## Methodology
- Data collected over 25 days
- 5 random daily samples, each with a volume of approximately 3.92 liters
- Control chart constructed to analyze variation

## Findings
- All sample values fell within the upper and lower control limits
- No runs or trends suggesting special cause variation
- No points showed abnormal behavior or bias

### Conclusion
The manufacturing process is statistically in control. Observed variations are expected and consistent. There is no indication of machinery malfunction or need for intervention.
